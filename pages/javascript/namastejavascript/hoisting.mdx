# Hoisting in JavaScript

- Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during code execution.
- Hoisting means that even if you write code in a specific order, some parts of it, especially variable and function declarations, seem to get moved up a little bit behind the scenes.

```js showLineNumbers copy
// Without hoisting
console.log(x);
var x = 5;

// With hoisting
var x; // Declaration is moved up
console.log(x); // Now, x exists but is undefined
x = 5; // Assignment happens here
```

- `var` declarations are hoisted and initialized with a value of undefined, const and let declarations are hoisted but not initialized.

```js showLineNumbers copy
console.log(x); // Throws an error: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
const x = 5;
```

- `const` declarations are hoisted, but they are not initialized with a value like var declarations are.

```js showLineNumbers copy
// Example of var and let/const

// using var
console.log(a); // Outputs: undefined
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // Outputs: 10

// using let
console.log(b); // Throws an error: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b = 20;
console.log(b); // This line is not reached due to the error

// using const
console.log(x); // Throws an error: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
const x = 5;
```
