- Everything in JavaScript happens inside an **Execution Context**.

## Components of Execution Context

- Memory (also known as variable environment)
- Code (also known as thread of execution).

- JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language.

**Single threaded**: JavaScript can execute one command at a time.

**Synchronous single threaded**: JavaScript can only execute one command at a time in a specific order.
