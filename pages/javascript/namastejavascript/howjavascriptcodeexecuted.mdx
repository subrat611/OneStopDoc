## Call Stack?

> The call stack is a data structure that records the execution context of a program.
>
> In simpler terms, it keeps track of where the program is in its execution.
>
> Imagine it as a stack of function calls, with the currently executing function at the top.
>
> Each time a function is called, a new frame is added to the stack, and when a function completes, its frame is popped off.
