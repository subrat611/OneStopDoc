# Let & const in JS, Temporal Dead Zone

## Let & const declaration are hoisted

### Temporal Dead Zone

- In JavaScript, the "temporal dead zone" refers to the period within a scope where a variable exists but cannot be accessed or used before its declaration. This behavior is specific to variables declared using the **`let`** and **`const`** keywords, which were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to provide block-scoped variable declarations.
- The phase from hoisting till it assigns or gets some values that phase is known as the temporal dead zone. **from line 1 to line 3 is in the temporal dead zone.**

```js showLineNumbers
console.log(myVar); // Throws a ReferenceError during the temporal dead zone
let myVar = 10; // Variable declaration
console.log(myVar); // Outputs 10
```

- In the case of var and let, var can re-declare the variable but let can not.

```js showLineNumbers
console.log("hello")
//Due to the re-declaration of the let variable the code gets terminate
// and doesn't move to the next line.
let a = 0; ❌
let a = 0; ❌


// In case of var the re-declaration is possible
console.log("hello")
var a = 0; ✅
var a = 0; ✅

// In case of const
// The initialization happen at that moment of declaration
// The re-initialization doesn't happen after assigning a value in the const declaration

const a = 10; // the rest of the concept for const is the same as let
a = 100 ❌
```

## Error

### Type Error

- In JavaScript, a "TypeError" is a type of error that occurs when an operation is performed on a value of a type that is not appropriate for that operation. In other words, it indicates that a value does not have the expected type or structure for a particular operation to be executed successfully.

```js showLineNumbers
const a = 0;
a = 0; //TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

```js showLineNumbers
1. Incorrect Function Invocation
// Calling a function that doesn't exist or attempting to call an object as if it were a function.

// Example of trying to call a non-existent function
nonExistentFunction(); // Throws a TypeError

// Example of calling an object as a function
const myObject = {};
myObject(); // Throws a TypeError

2. Property Access on Non-Objects:
// Trying to access a property or method of a value that is not an object or null.

const num = 42;
num.length; // Throws a TypeError, as numbers don't have a "length" property

const nullValue = null;
nullValue.property; // Throws a TypeError, as null is not an object

3. Mismatched Data Types:
// Performing operations on values that are of incompatible types.

const str = "Hello";
const num = 42;
const result = str + num; // Concatenation of string and number, no TypeError
const wrongResult = str - num; // Subtraction of string and number, TypeError

4. Incorrect Usage of Built-in Objects:
// Misusing built-in objects like Date or RegExp without following the appropriate syntax.

const invalidDate = new Date("not a date"); // Creates an invalid Date object, may cause TypeError
const invalidRegExp = new RegExp("["); // Throws a TypeError due to invalid regular expression

5. Using Undefined Values:
// Attempting to access properties or elements of undefined values.

let myVar;
console.log(myVar.property); // Throws a TypeError

const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(myArray[10]); // Undefined, no TypeError

6. Using Null Pointer:
// Trying to access properties or elements of null values.

const myObject = null;
console.log(myObject.property); // Throws a TypeError
```

### Syntax Error

```js showLineNumbers
const a; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
let b = 10;
let b = 10; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared
```

### Reference Error

```js showLineNumbers
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
let a = 10;

console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
// because of a is in the temporal dead zone
let a = 10;
```

## How To Avoid Temporal Dead Zone?

- Push everything all of your declaration and initialization at the top.
