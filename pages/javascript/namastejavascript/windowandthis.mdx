# What is a window object and where it comes from?

- When a javascript program runs on the browser the javascript engine creates a `global context` along with at the global level, the `window` is created.

  - Just like browsers the different engines create this `window` object.
  - In the case of node also there is a `global object` created.

  ```js showLineNumbers
  this === window; // true
  ```

- If I put a variable and function in the global scope (not in a function). These are attached to the global object called `window`.

```js showLineNumbers
var a = 10;
function b() {
  var c = 20;
}
// a and b() function visible in window object
```
