## What is Closure?

- Closure is a function bind together with it's lexical environment.
- Function along with it's lexical scope forms a closure.

> MDN
>
> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

### Example

```js showLineNumbers copy
function parentFun() {
  var a = 7;

  function childFun() {
    console.log(a);
  }

  childFun();
}

parentFun();
```

### Explanation

- Inside `childFun` it form a closure with the variable which were part of `parentFun` lexical scope.

## Use Cases

- `Data Encapsulation:` Helps in creating private variables.
- `Functional Programming:` Enables the creation of functions with behavior dependent on an enclosed scope.
- Module Design Pattern
- Currying
- Memoize
- Function like `once`
- Maintaining state in async world
- setTimeout
- Iterators etc...
