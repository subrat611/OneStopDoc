# Scope Chain, Scope & Lexical Environment

## What is Scope?

- Scope, where you can access specific variables or functions in our code.
- The term "scope" refers to the context in which variables are declared and accessed.
- It defines where a particular variable or function is visible and accessible within your code.

```js showLineNumbers
var globalVar = 10;

function doSomething() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Accessible here
}

console.log(globalVar); // Also accessible here
```

```js showLineNumbers
function doSomething() {
  var localVar = 20;
  // localVar has local scope, accessible only inside this function
  console.log(localVar);
}

doSomething(); // Outputs 20
console.log(localVar); // Throws an error, localVar is not accessible here
```

## What is Lexical Environment?

- The lexical environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent.

```js showLineNumbers
function a() {
  var b = 10;
  c();
  function c() {}
}

a();
console.log(b);
```

### What is Lexical?

- The term lexical means, In hierarchy or in sequence.
- From the above code, we can say that the `c(){...} function` lexically/physically sits inside `a(){...} function`. and same for `a(){..} function` lexically sits inside global scope.
