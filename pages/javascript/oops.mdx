# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Overview

- OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **Objects**, which can contain data in the form of **fields** (often known as properties or attributes) and code in the form of **procedures** (often known as methods).
- We can simply say **Objects = attributes + methods**.

# Key OOP Principles

1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction

# "this" keyword

- The this keyword in JavaScript is a fundamental concept that refers to the context in which a function is executed.

- Understanding this can be challenging because its value can change based on how and where a function is called.

## 1. Global Context

In the global context (outside of any function or object), this refers to the global object. In a browser, this is the window object.

```js showLineNumbers
console.log(this); // Window object in a browser
```

## 2. Function Context

When this is used inside a function, its value depends on how the function is called.

### Regular Function Call

In a regular function call, this refers to the global object (or undefined in strict mode).

```js showLineNumbers
function showThis() {
  console.log(this);
}

showThis(); // Window (or global object), undefined in strict mode
```

### Method Call

When a function is called as a method of an object, this refers to the object the method is called on.

```js showLineNumbers
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

person.greet(); // John
```

## 3. Arrow Functions

Arrow functions do not have their own this context. Instead, they inherit this from the enclosing lexical context (the context in which they were defined).

This makes arrow functions particularly useful in scenarios where you want to preserve the this value from the outer scope.

```js showLineNumbers
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function () {
    const innerFunction = () => {
      console.log(this.name);
    };
    innerFunction();
  },
};

person.greet(); // John
```

## 4. Constructor Functions

When a function is used as a constructor (called with the new keyword), this refers to the newly created instance.

```js showLineNumbers
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const person = new Person("John");
console.log(person.name); // John
```

## 5. Event Handlers

In event handlers, this refers to the element that received the event.

```js showLineNumbers
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log(this); // The button element
});
```

## 6. Explicit Binding

The bind method creates a new function that, when called, has this set to the provided value.

Unlike call and apply, bind does not immediately call the function, instead it returns a new function.

```js showLineNumbers
function greet() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const person = { name: "John" };
const boundGreet = greet.bind(person);

boundGreet(); // John
```

## 7. Class Methods

In ES6 classes, methods use this to refer to the instance of the class.

```js showLineNumbers
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
  }
}

const person = new Person("John");
person.greet(); // Hello, John
```

## 8. Common Pitfalls

Losing this in Callbacks

When passing methods as callbacks, this can be lost. This is a common issue in asynchronous code.

```js showLineNumbers
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

setTimeout(person.greet, 1000); // undefined or error, `this` is lost
```

To fix this, you can use bind or arrow functions:

```js showLineNumbers
setTimeout(person.greet.bind(person), 1000); // John

setTimeout(() => person.greet(), 1000); // John
```

### Summary

1. Global Context: this refers to the global object.
2. Function Context: this can refer to the global object, the object on which a method is called, or undefined in strict mode.
3. Arrow Functions: this inherits from the enclosing lexical context.
4. Constructor Functions: this refers to the newly created instance.
5. Event Handlers: this refers to the element that received the event.
6. Explicit Binding: call, apply, and bind methods can explicitly set this.
7. Class Methods: this refers to the instance of the class.
