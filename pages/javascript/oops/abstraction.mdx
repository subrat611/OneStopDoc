# Abstraction

- Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
- It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

Abstraction can be achieved by using interfaces and abstract classes. While JavaScript does not have built-in support for abstract classes, it can be simulated using normal classes.

```js showLineNumbers
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    if (this.constructor === Animal) {
      throw new Error(
        'Abstract class "Animal" cannot be instantiated directly.'
      );
    }
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    throw new Error('Method "speak()" must be implemented.');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} meows.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog("Rex");
const cat = new Cat("Whiskers");

dog.speak(); // Rex barks.
cat.speak(); // Whiskers meows.
```
