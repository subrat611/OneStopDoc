# Introduction

## What is Testing?

- Testing involves evaluating a software application or system to ensure that it meets its intended requirements and functions correctly.
- The primary goal of testing is to identify and fix defects or issues in the software to enhance its quality and reliability
- When it comes to React/Vue or any other framework, testing is particularly important for verifying the behavior of React components, making sure they render correctly, responding to user interactions as expected, and handling state and props appropriately.
- Testing libraries and tools designed for React/Vue or any other framework, like Jest and React Testing Library, help you achieve these goals efficiently and reliably.

## Types of Testing

### **Functional Testing**

- This type of testing assesses whether the software functions as specified in the requirements. It includes test cases that check individual features and functionalities.

### **Non-Functional Testing**

- This focuses on non-functional aspects such as performance, security, scalability, and usability. Examples include load testing, security testing, and usability testing.

### **Unit Testing**

- This involves testing individual components or units of code in isolation to ensure that they work as expected.

## Testing Levels

### **Manual Testing**

- Testers execute test cases manually without automation tools. This is useful for exploratory testing and ad-hoc testing.
- An individual will open the website, interact with the website, and ensure everything works as intended.
- If a new feature is released, he/she repeats the same steps. It also includes testing new features as well as existing features.

**Drawbacks**

1. Time-consuming
2. Complex repetitive tasks have a risk of human error
3. In a short time, you may not get a chance to test all the features you should.

## Automated Testing

- Test scripts and tools are used to automate test case execution, making it efficient and repeatable.

**Advantages**

1. Not time-consuming
2. Reliable, consistent, and not error-prone (because the computer is good at doing repetitive and complex tasks)
3. Easy to identify and fix features that break tests
4. Give confidence when shipping software
